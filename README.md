# DrUUID
"DrUUID" is an implementation for PHP5 of---and associated API for---the data format described in RFC 4122, A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace. It is able to mint new UUIDs, import existing UUIDs, extract information from UUIDs, and compare two UUIDs for bit-exact equality.
